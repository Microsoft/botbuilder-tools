# LUDown

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ludown.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ludown)

.lu files help describe language understanding components for your bot. LUDown is a command line tool that helps convert .lu file(s) into JSON files that you can then use to create your [LUIS](http://luis.ai) app or [QnAMaker](http://qnamaker.ai) knowledge base. 

Language Understanding ([LUIS.ai](https://luis.ai/)) allows your application to understand what a person wants in their own words. LUIS uses machine learning to allow developers to build applications that can receive user input in natural language and extract meaning from it.

[QnA Maker](http://qnamaker.ai) enables you to go from FAQ to bot in minutes. With QnA Maker you can build, train and publish a simple question and answer bot based on FAQ URLs, structured documents or editorial content in minutes.

The .lu file and the LUDown tool serve several use cases:
- Quick, simple and easy way to bootstrap language understanding for your bot.
- Describe intents, entities, utterances and patterns for your bot in simple markdown documents.
- The language understanding definition for your bot lives with the rest of your code. You can use other CLI tools like luis to create a new LUIS app using the .lu files.
- Group language understanding documents by language and locale to easily manage localization.
- Define question and answer pairs for your bot.
- Works in conjunction with other Microsoft Bot Builder tools, like [LUIS CLI](../LUIS) and [QnAMaker CLI](../QnAMaker).
